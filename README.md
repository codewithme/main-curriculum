# <em>Code with me</em> main curriculum
Our most current curriculum is the main curriculum taught during the <em>Code with me</em> Miami workshop on Feb. 2-3, 2012. We'll be making changes as we get closer to our Portland workshop. Our presentations are built using [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).

We strive to improve the curriculum after (and yes, also during) each of our workshops. So as lessons change, we'd like to keep an archive of them here, in the branches.
